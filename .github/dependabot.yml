# Dependabot configuration files that automate our dependency updates by creating pull requests.
# The PRs are labeled and grouped by package ecosystem and semver update type.
# We intentionally use grouping and pull request limits to avoid creating too many PRs and
# exhausting the number of available pull requests in Lagoon.
